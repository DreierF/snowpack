# Snowpack Docs

We aim to follow the [Divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/) though a lot of our docs are legacy and don't necessarily fit it yet.

## Architecture

- Markdown files that become pages are in `/template`
- SASS files in `css`
- templates in `_includes`

## Style Guide
- Terminology
  - Snowpack app is a Snowpack SPA (single page application)
  - Snowpack project is any software that uses Snowpack, can include Snowpack app and other software built with Snowpack like 11ty sites or front-end only for SSR (server side rendering)
  - Snowpack site is a website generated by Snowpack
- Sentence-style capitalization
- Oxford comma
- Don't capitalize after colons
- Avoid using future tense and passive tense if possible, for example "will rebuild" should be "rebuilds"

### Code Blocks

Code blocks should include a file name on the top in a comment. Example:

```js
// snowpack.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ['@snowpack/plugin-sass', { /* see options below */ }
  ],
};
```
